# Patient Monitor
A web interface for monitoring patient audio over secured networks. Used in conjunction with Raspberry Pi systems connected to microphones broadcast over Icecast.

# Features
- Audio stream grouping (e.g., by room)
- Solo mode (mute other streams to focus on a single one temporarily)
- Alarm heuristics (signals presence of audio alerts)
- Filtering (designed to remove noises from constantly-on fans)
- Spectrogram (visualize audio over time at a glance)
